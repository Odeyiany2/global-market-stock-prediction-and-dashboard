# **📈 Predicting Global Stock Market Performance Using Macroeconomic Indicators**

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes global financial and macroeconomic data across 39 countries to understand the relationships between stock indices, economic indicators, and risk factors.

Using Machine Learning (Stacking Regressor), the project predicts daily stock index percentage changes based on features such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, unemployment, commodity prices, and political risk scores.

It also includes:

* An interactive Streamlit app where users can input macroeconomic indicators and get stock market predictions.

* A Power BI dashboard for financial storytelling, allowing dynamic exploration of global markets, risks, and stability.

## 🔎 **Objectives**

 * Analyze how macroeconomic and risk indicators influence stock indices.

* Build machine learning models to predict stock market performance.

* Create a dashboard to visualize insights for investors and policymakers.

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**

* Languages: Python, SQL

* Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, LightGBM, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn

* Deployment: Streamlit

* Visualization: Power BI

* Version Control: Git/GitHub
